# Description

In this project, we conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Flight Travel datasets, aiming to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. At this stage, our goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure and content. While EDA will guide us in identifying significant features and relationships, the possibility of applying machine learning or deep learning techniques remains an open question. By thoroughly examining the data, we seek to determine whether predictive or advanced analytical models would add value to the insights gained.
